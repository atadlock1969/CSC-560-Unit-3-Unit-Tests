What I thought was going to be a step-by-step tutorial learning, did twists and turns to incompletion. This does not make me happy and all in all I am not satisfied where I ended for this assignment. My first pass through of the Unit Test assignment, I was getting errors on an invalid character syntax. At that point, I decided to begin again. I even did a second review of the tutorial to help me focus before my second try. 

I was also having issues with MongoSH and Mongod being executed from the Command session. I had to add their paths to the System environment variable settings. It was interesting to see that some variables accepted the full path with the file name but for MongoSH and Mongod, my settings only wanted the folder paths. Once I got that straighten out it was back to the Unit Test assignment with a little work on the side of doing a simpler CRUD assignment so I can start to understand the programming language and syntax as well as how the Restful structure works.


My first ah-ha moment for the Unit Test assignment was some missing packages. The errors did not reflect this, but it became obvious as I walked through each step of the assignment. To avoid missing any packages, I took extra time during the second run through to carefully add each one. I even counted the installations and that is where my true troubles began. I could not get the express-stormpath to install. I tried numerous times. I even cleared the packages and restarted. I created a test folder to run through the package installations. Even after reaching out to Professor Litman who gave me a command recommendation and a suggestion of running my Command session as administrator, I still could not resolve the problem. I forced cleared the npm cache, updated the npm packages numerous times and even uninstalled node.js and re-installed it with the same results. It appears that the express-stormpath has deprecated and my workstation does not like it. Yet other packages have similar flags and all I received were warnings. 

So, I do have my broken app and I am submitting with the trepidation that I could not fully check for more bugs and to ensure the code is as clean as possible. This is disappointing to me and goes against my character to provide the best work I can.

With all this, I completed a simple CRUD API that should help me with the second assignment. 

This effort took me more hours than I would like to admit. I was topping 40 hours and that makes the results even more disappointing. Hence, I decided to submit my work and hope for the best.
